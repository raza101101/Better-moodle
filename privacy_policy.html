                    <h2>1. How We Collect Your Information</h2>
                    <p>Harzarian collects personal data from you when you interact with us. This can be through our websites, over the phone, in person, including, without limitation, when you:
                        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">

                    <!--Point 2-->
                    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We may need to pass your personal data on to third-party service providers contracted to Harzarian in the course of dealing with you. We do this because there are services, such as our video conferencing facility, which will not work unless we are able to make these transfers. Any third parties we share your data with are obliged to keep your personal data secure and use it only for necessary service delivery. When your data is no longer required to fulfil the service, those third parties will be directed to dispose of your data in accordance with our standard procedures.</p>
                    <p>We seek to enter into Data Processing Agreements with our third party service providers to ensure they only process your data as instructed by us. If you obtain products or services directly from us on behalf of others we will ensure you enter into a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with us. It will be your responsibility to enter into terms with your students/employees/customers to ensure their use of our systems is clearly understood.</p>
                    <!--Point 3-->
                    <h2>3. Storing Information</h2>
                    <p>We will process (collect, store and use) the information you provide in a manner compatible with GDPR. We maintain physical, organisational and technical safeguards for all personal data we hold. We will endeavour to keep your information accurate and up to date, and not keep it for longer than is necessary. We are required to retain certain information in accordance with the law, such as information needed for income tax and audit purposes. How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept are governed by specific business sector requirements and agreed practices. Personal data can be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.</p>
                    <p>We will process different forms of personal data for as long as it is necessary and proportionate for the purpose for which it has been supplied and we will store the personal data for the shortest amount of time possible, taking into account legal and service requirements.</p>
                    <!--Point 4-->
                    <h2>4. Marketing</h2>
                    <p>We have no interest in collecting any data beyond that needed to ensure our services work for you. If you are going to be contacted by us for marketing purposes, we will not rely solely on this privacy notice. We will endeavour to seek your consent appropriately. Harzarian does not sell data, and has no intentions in doing so in the future.</p>
                    <!--Point 5-->
